## [Unreleased]
## [v2.0.0] - 2025-01-28
### Changed
- Support for PHP 8.4 added, and PHP 8.1 dropped.
- Fixups for PHP 8.4 implicit nullable type declarations have been made. 
  - This is a breaking change if you were extending the `ListCache` or `MapCache` classes and overriding their constructors.
  - All other fixups impact functions and should not have an impact.
- The `_` base class has been renamed `_Lodash`, as `_` as a class name has been deprecated.
  - The *namespace* `_` remains, so invocations of the functions as `\_\map()` will continue to function.
  - The `_` *constant* remains, so accessing the `_` class with that via the constant will continue to work.
